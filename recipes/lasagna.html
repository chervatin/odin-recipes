    <p>Delicious lasagna with a white creamy sauce. A family favorite!</p>
    <p>You should try it!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>¼ cup margarine</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup light ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir flour, salt, and pepper into the melted margarine until smooth and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Add milk and broth into flour mixture, stirring constantly; bring sauce to a boil. Stir wine into sauce and remove from heat. Stir Parmesan cheese into sauce until smooth.</li>
        <li>Whisk ricotta cheese, egg, and egg white together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute carrots, zucchini, and spinach until just becoming tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir vegetable mixture into ricotta mixture.</li>
        <li>Layer 1/3 the lasagna noodles, 1/3 the ricotta-vegetable mixture, and 1/3 the Parmesan sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish; repeat layering 2 more times with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is lightly browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
